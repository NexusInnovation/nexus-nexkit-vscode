# Debug Chat Mode

Use this mode when debugging issues in your code.

## Guidelines

1. **Reproduce the issue**: Can you consistently reproduce the problem?
2. **Isolate the cause**: What's the smallest change that fixes it?
3. **Check logs**: Are there error messages or clues?
4. **Use debugging tools**: Breakpoints, logging, profilers
5. **Test the fix**: Does it resolve the issue without breaking other things?

## Steps

1. **Gather information**: What were you doing when the issue occurred?
2. **Reproduce**: Try to make it happen again
3. **Investigate**: Look at logs, stack traces, variable values
4. **Hypothesize**: What might be causing the issue?
5. **Test hypothesis**: Make a small change and test
6. **Fix**: Implement the solution
7. **Verify**: Test that the fix works and doesn't break anything else
