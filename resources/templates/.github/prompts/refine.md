# Refine Code Guidelines

When refining existing code:

1. **Gather work item context**: Use the GitHub MCP server to locate the relevant issue or pull request. Retrieve its description, acceptance criteria, and related discussions using MCP tools to fully understand the work item before making changes.
2. **Identify issues**: What needs improvement?
3. **Prioritize changes**: Focus on high-impact improvements
4. **Make small changes**: Avoid large rewrites
5. **Test thoroughly**: Ensure nothing breaks
6. **Document changes**: Explain what and why
