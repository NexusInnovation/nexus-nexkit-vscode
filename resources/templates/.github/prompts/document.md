# Documentation Guidelines

When documenting code or features:

1. **Write for your future self**: Assume the reader knows the codebase
2. **Include examples**: Show how to use the feature
3. **Explain why, not just what**: Include rationale for design decisions
4. **Keep it up to date**: Update docs when code changes

## Structure

- **Overview**: What does this feature do?
- **Usage**: How to use it with code examples
- **Configuration**: Any settings or options
- **Examples**: Real-world use cases
