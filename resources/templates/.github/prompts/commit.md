# Commit Message Guidelines

When creating commit messages, follow these guidelines:

1. **Keep it concise**: Limit the subject line to 50 characters
2. **Use imperative mood**: Start with a verb like "Add", "Fix", "Update"
3. **Be specific**: Describe what changed, not how it changed
4. **Reference issues**: Include issue numbers when applicable

## Examples

Good commit messages:
- Add user authentication feature
- Fix memory leak in data processing
- Update documentation for API endpoints

Bad commit messages:
- Changed some stuff
- Bug fix
- Updated code
