# Implementation Guidelines

When implementing new features:

1. **Plan before coding**: Think through the design first
2. **Write tests first**: TDD approach when possible
3. **Keep it simple**: Avoid over-engineering
4. **Follow existing patterns**: Maintain consistency
5. **Document as you go**: Update docs and comments

## Steps

1. **Understand requirements**: What problem are you solving?
2. **Design the solution**: Sketch out the approach
3. **Write tests**: Define expected behavior
4. **Implement**: Write the code
5. **Test**: Verify it works
6. **Refactor**: Clean up the code
7. **Document**: Update relevant docs
