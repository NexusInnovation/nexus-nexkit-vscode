# Code Review Guidelines

When reviewing code:

1. **Check functionality**: Does it work as intended?
2. **Review code quality**: Is it readable and maintainable?
3. **Look for bugs**: Edge cases, error handling, security
4. **Verify tests**: Are there adequate tests?
5. **Check documentation**: Is it clear and complete?

## Focus Areas

- **Logic errors**: Does the code do what it's supposed to?
- **Performance**: Any obvious inefficiencies?
- **Security**: Potential vulnerabilities?
- **Maintainability**: Will this be easy to change later?
- **Testing**: Can this be easily tested?
